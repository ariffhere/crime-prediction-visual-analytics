## Crime Prediction with Data-Driven Intelligence

Objective  
Analyze and forecast U.S. crime patterns to support data-driven public safety and resource allocation decisions.

Data  
Nationwide crime dataset (2018–2024) containing offense types, geographic regions, population coverage, and law enforcement agency counts.

Approach  
- Performed exploratory and visual analysis using Tableau to identify crime distribution, seasonality, hotspots, and regional disparities  
- Built interactive dashboards including geographic maps, heatmaps, and time-series trends  
- Developed machine learning models (Random Forest, clustering) to classify crime types and forecast incident volumes  

Key Insights  
- Property crimes dominate overall crime volume across regions  
- Strong seasonal patterns with crime peaks during mid-year months  
- Misalignment observed between crime intensity and agency coverage in several states  

Tools  
Tableau, Python, scikit-learn, Excel

Notes  
Tableau workbook requires a local data connection. Dataset is included for reproducibility.
